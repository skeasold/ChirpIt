<p>ChirpIt is my take on integrating Twitter and Reddit functionality.</p>

<p>Users are able to sign up and post their thoguhts. Users are able to follow other users
  and view thier posts along with those they follow within thier feed.</p>

<p>A Trending Feed is a collection of all user posts. Users are able to browse
  this feed and vote on all other posts which will either increase or decrease
  the posts' position within the trending feed. Users are also able to comment
  on posts to start a conversation.</p>

<p>Viewers are able to view the Trending Feed but are unable to post comments, add
  new posts, vote or follow other users. Users can edit only their post and comment content 
  and are unable to vote for their own posts.<p>
